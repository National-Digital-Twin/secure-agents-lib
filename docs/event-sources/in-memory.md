# In-Memory Event Source

<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: OGL-UK-3.0 -->

The `InMemoryEventSource` is an event source backed by a simple `Queue`.  The events are populated when the source is
constructed and this is primarily intended for use in unit testing and debugging of data processing pipelines.

An in-memory event source is bounded, i.e. it represents a finite stream of events, thus it can be exhausted by polling
all the events it is populated with.

## Behaviours

- Bounded
- Buffered
- Configurable Read Policy: No

## Parameters

This source simply takes in a `Collection<Event<TKey, TValue>>` representing the events it should provide.

## Example Usage

In this example we create a source from a predefined list of events generating event keys as an integer sequence, the
contents of the event source are then printed out:

```java
List<String> events = Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f");
AtomicInteger id = new AtomicInteger(0);
EventSource<Event<Integer, String>> source 
  = new InMemoryEventSource<>(events.stream().map(v -> new SimpleEvent(Collections.emptyList(), 
                                                                       id.incrementAndGet(), 
                                                                       v)));

while (true) {
  // Once exhausted stop reading
  if (source.isExhausted())
    break;

  Event<Integer, String> event = source.poll(Duration.ofSeconds(1));
  System.out.println(Integer.toString(event.key()) + ": " + event.value());
}
source.close();
```
