# Security Policy

**Repository:** `secure-agents-lib`  
**Description:** `Details the responsible disclosure process for security vulnerabilities.`  
<!-- SPDX-License-Identifier: OGL-UK-3.0 -->

## Responsible Disclosure

The National Digital Twin Programme (NDTP) follows a **Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD)** process to ensure security risks are addressed responsibly.  

By reporting security vulnerabilities through the responsible channels, you agree to:

- Not disclose details of the vulnerability publicly until NDTP has had a reasonable opportunity to fix it.
- Provide NDTP with adequate time to assess and mitigate the risk.
- Act in good faith and follow ethical security research principles.  

NDTP reserves the right to take necessary action against unauthorised or harmful security testing activities.

## Reporting Security Issues

NDTP takes security seriously and encourages responsible reporting of vulnerabilities.  

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this repository, **please do not report it publicly**. Instead, follow the steps below to disclose the issue responsibly.

### **How to Report a Security Issue**

1. **Do not open a public issue on GitHub.** Instead, report security concerns via email to **[ndtp@businessandtrade.gov.uk]**.
2. **Provide detailed information about the vulnerability**, including:
    - A clear description of the issue.
    - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    - Potential impact or risk level.
    - Any suggested mitigation strategies.
3. **Allow time for assessment and response.** NDTP will review the report and respond within **10 working days** to acknowledge receipt.
4. **Cooperate with NDTP to validate and address the issue.**

Once a resolution has been identified, NDTP may choose to:
- **Release a patch** as part of the next scheduled update.
- **Issue a security advisory** if the issue is critical.
- **Provide acknowledgments** where appropriate (subject to NDTP’s disclosure policy).

## Scope

This security policy applies to:
- All NDTP repositories released as open source.
- Code, configuration files, and infrastructure deployed as part of NDTP’s **Integration Architecture (IA)**.
- **Third-party dependencies** included within NDTP repositories. If you identify a vulnerability in a third-party component that NDTP relies on (e.g., outdated libraries
  or known security flaws in dependencies), we encourage you to report it.

Out of scope:
- Issues related to third-party services or software **not used within NDTP repositories**.
- Vulnerabilities in user environments that are unrelated to this repository.
- Unsolicited security testing or penetration testing without NDTP’s explicit permission.

## Security Best Practices

To help maintain security across NDTP repositories, we follow these principles:
- Dependencies are **scanned and updated regularly** (e.g., using automated tools like Dependabot).
- Sensitive credentials **must not be included** in public repositories.
- Security patches are applied in a timely manner, with priority given to critical vulnerabilities.  

For more details, refer to our **Secure Development Guidelines** [Link to internal security policy, if available].
